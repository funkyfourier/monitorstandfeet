## Parametric 3D Printable Monitor Stand Feet

Set of feet for building a monitor stand, suitable to use with a wooden plate. Default plate dimensions are 300mm width and 18mm thickness, and can be easily adjusted in the FreeCAD spreadsheet.

The center piece is probably not strictly needed, it is mostly to obscure the edges of the plate which in my case was not very nice.

Print two sets lying down like this:

The dimensions can easily be adjusted in the FreeCAD spreadsheet:

Be sure to allow a millimeter or so in width for tolerance, and maybe 0.1-0.3 in thickness depending on your plate. Also be aware of dimension variations in wooden plates. Mine was said to be 300mm in width but was actually 303mm.

There are also two cut down versions of the corner feet to be used as drill guides.
